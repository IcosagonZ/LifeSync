# LifeSync

## About

LifeSyncAI is a student wellness app designed to analyze lifestlye habits and their influence on academic influence on students. This app integrates manually entered data like sleep duration, physical activity, study hours and grades with AI based food recognition for calorie estimation.

Food images uploaded by user will be processed using a deep learning model trained on Food 101 dataset with backend implemented using Python and Flask.

Front end will be made using Flutter for mobile friendly cross platform data entry, visualization and interaction. AI based analysis is applied to all data to identify trends to correlate lifestyle factors and academic outcomes.
